In this repository you can find the solutions to problems form Hakerrank and UVa I came up with. This repository wil be regularly updated has I solve the problems. Each problem file has an explanation of the solution.

>Please note that being well-versed in competitive programming is not the end goal, but only a means to an end. The true goal is t produce all-rounder computer scientists/programmers who are much readier to produce better software and to face harder CS research problems in the future.
